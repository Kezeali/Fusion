	 * It is recomended that you use the factory methods (CreateBody(...), 
	 * DestroyBody(...)) rather than constructing bodies manually.
	 *
	 * Terrain distance check: <br>
	 *  option one - check all <br>
	 *  option two - regions generated by projection (each landmass is projected out and 
	 *   'lit' (not blocked by other LMs) areas are the landmass' region)
	 *   (will need to be updated whenever a landmass splits...)
