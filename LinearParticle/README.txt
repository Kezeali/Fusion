LinearParticle 0.45
============================================================================
LinearParticle is an easy-to-use 2D particle engine for Clanlib. It is a
simple and small particle engine but powerful enough to be used to make eye
candy 2D visual effects for games. No graphical editor for LinearParticle
is available yet. 

LinearParticle 0.45 has been tested with Clanlib 0.8.0. If you are using
Clanlib 0.8.0 RC2 or earlier, it's recommended upgrading to later version.
